# Rust Ray tracer

Ray tracer implemented in Rust from https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io
The code is quite simple, a lot of rust improvement could be done and probably make everything faster.
The two first lesson have been done so far, the ray tracer in one week-end and the Ray tracer in one week.
